# Resonance - Project Overview

## What We're Building

**Resonance** is a cinematic visual generation tool for organic and ambient music. It creates unique, narrative-driven visuals that respond to the subtle nuances of real instruments - breath, sustain, vibrato, silence, and emotional arc.

Unlike traditional music visualizers that react to beats and volume, Resonance **understands musical storytelling** and creates visuals that enhance the emotional journey of organic music.

## The Core Problem

**Musicians creating organic/ambient music have no good visual tools:**

- EDM visualizers are designed for electronic beats (glitchy, digital, aggressive)
- Manual video editing takes 20-40 hours per song
- AI video generators are slow, expensive, and unpredictable
- Template tools produce generic, repetitive results
- No tools understand the subtlety of acoustic instruments

**The gap:** Organic musicians need visuals that feel alive, respond to nuance, and tell a story.

## The Solution

**Three-layer intelligent compositing system:**

```
Layer 1: FOOTAGE (Optional user-provided video/images)
   ↓ (Grounding, human element, narrative anchor)
   
Layer 2: EFFECTS (Code-driven transformations)
   ↓ (Fluid distortion, color grading, organic enhancement)
   
Layer 3: GENERATIVE (Pure algorithmic visuals)
   ↓ (Particles, fractals, geometric patterns, light)
   
= FINAL OUTPUT: Cinematic visual story
```

**Key innovations:**

1. **Deep audio analysis** - Detects pitch, harmony, dynamics, timbre, expression, emotion
2. **Subtle cue detection** - Notices breath, string sustain, vibrato, meaningful silence
3. **Narrative understanding** - AI maps emotional arc and creates visual story
4. **Massive effect library** - 500-1000+ code-driven visual techniques
5. **Intelligent blending** - Knows when to show footage vs abstract
6. **Generative uniqueness** - Never the same output twice
